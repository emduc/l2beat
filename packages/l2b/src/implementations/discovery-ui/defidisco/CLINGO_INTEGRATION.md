# Clingo-Based Permission Resolution Integration

**Status**: Partially complete - works for small projects, WebAssembly limitation for large projects
**Date**: October 15, 2025
**Goal**: Replace custom recursive permission resolution with L2BEAT's Clingo-based approach

## Summary

Successfully integrated L2BEAT's Clingo-based permission resolution system to replace our custom recursive implementation. The integration works correctly for small projects (compound-v3) but encounters WebAssembly resource limitations with larger projects (lido with 147 permission facts).

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Created Clingo Fact Generation (`generateDefidiscoClingo.ts`)
- Converts `permission-overrides.json` to Clingo facts compatible with L2BEAT's `modelPermissions.lp`
- Generates proper `permission(receiver, "type", giver, delay, description, "role")` facts
- Generates `address(modelId, "chain", "fullAddress")` facts with chain specifiers
- Generates `addressType(address, type)` facts mapping to Clingo types (eoa, contract, multisig)
- **Performance optimization**: Generates `canActIndependently(address)` facts to avoid expensive negation inference
- Tracks addresses that pass `"act"` permissions to determine independence
- Adds dummy rules for optional predicates (msig, member, permissionCondition, preventActingIndependently)

### 2. Created Resolution Logic (`clingoPermissionResolution.ts`)
- Main entry point: `resolvePermissionsForProject(paths, project)`
- Uses L2BEAT's infrastructure:
  - `runClingoForSingleModel()` - runs Clingo WebAssembly solver
  - `parseClingoFact()` - parses Clingo output
  - `KnowledgeBase` - stores and queries facts
  - `ModelIdRegistry` - maps model IDs to ChainSpecificAddresses
- Parses `ultimatePermission` facts from Clingo output
- Builds `resolved-permissions.json` with proper structure
- Includes metadata: version, lastModified, generatedFrom
- Saves debug output to `clingo-debug.lp` for inspection

### 3. Updated API Endpoint
- Modified POST `/api/projects/:project/resolve-permissions`
- Now calls `resolvePermissionsForProject()` instead of custom recursive resolution
- Saves output to `resolved-permissions.json`

### 4. Built and Tested
- Successfully tested with **compound-v3** project
  - Generates correct `resolved-permissions.json`
  - Properly resolves ultimate owners
  - Includes address types, via paths, delays
  - Example output in `/home/emilien/defidisco/packages/config/src/projects/compound-v3/resolved-permissions.json`

## Current Issue: WebAssembly Limitation with Lido

### Problem
When processing the **lido** project (147 permission facts, 40 addresses), Clingo WebAssembly aborts:

```
{"error":"Failed to resolve permissions","details":"...\nAborted()"}
```

### Symptoms
- Compound-v3 (1 permission fact): ✅ Works perfectly (< 1 second)
- Lido (147 permission facts): ❌ WebAssembly aborts after ~1-7 seconds
- The "info" warnings about missing predicates (msig, member, etc.) are harmless
- The real issue is `Aborted()` - WebAssembly termination

### What We Tried

#### Attempt 1: String Escaping
- **Problem**: Initially thought Clingo syntax errors from unescaped strings
- **Fix**: Implemented comprehensive `escapeString()` function
- **Result**: Didn't fix the issue; switched to using `nil` for descriptions

#### Attempt 2: Performance Optimization with `canActIndependently`
- **Problem**: Suspected expensive negation inference in Clingo rules
- **Theory**: Without explicit `canActIndependently` facts, Clingo uses negation in rules like:
  ```prolog
  canActIndependently(Actor) :-
    address(Actor, _, _),
    not permission(_, "act", Actor, _, _, _),
    not preventActingIndependently(Actor).
  ```
- **Fix**: Track addresses that pass "act" permissions and generate explicit `canActIndependently` facts
- **Result**: Reduced timeout from 60+ seconds to ~7 seconds, but still aborts

#### Attempt 3: Dummy Rules for Optional Predicates
- **Problem**: Thought Clingo warnings about missing predicates caused abort
- **Fix**: Added dummy rules to define unused predicates:
  ```typescript
  facts.push('msig("_dummy", 0) :- #false.')
  facts.push('member("_dummy", "_dummy") :- #false.')
  facts.push('permissionCondition(...) :- #false.')
  facts.push('preventActingIndependently("_dummy") :- #false.')
  ```
- **Result**: Didn't prevent the abort

### Root Cause Analysis

The issue appears to be **WebAssembly resource limitations**, not logic errors:

1. **Memory Limits**: WebAssembly has strict memory constraints
2. **Complexity**: 147 facts × 40 addresses creates combinatorial explosion in transitivePermission rules
3. **Rule Structure**: L2BEAT's `modelPermissions.lp` has recursive rules that expand exponentially:
   ```prolog
   transitivePermission(Receiver, OriginalPermission, Giver, ..., IndirectVia) :-
     Receiver != Via,
     transitivePermission(Via, OriginalPermission, Giver, ..., PreviousTotalVia),
     permission(Receiver, ViaPermission, Via, ...),
     ViaPermission == "act",
     ...
   ```
4. **Comparison**: L2BEAT likely processes larger fact sets, but may use native Clingo or different WASM configuration

```json
{
  "functions": [{
    "functionName": "changeAdmin",
    "ownerDefinitions": [{"path": "$self.$admin"}]
  }]
}
```

**Clingo Facts Generated**:
```prolog
permission(eth_0xc3d688B66703497DAA19211EEdff47f25384cdc3, "act", eth_0x1EC63B5883C3481134FD50D5DAebc83Ecd2E8779, 0, nil, "changeAdmin").
address(eth_0xc3d688B66703497DAA19211EEdff47f25384cdc3, "eth", "eth:0xc3d688B66703497DAA19211EEdff47f25384cdc3").
addressType(eth_0xc3d688B66703497DAA19211EEdff47f25384cdc3, contract).
canActIndependently(eth_0x1EC63B5883C3481134FD50D5DAebc83Ecd2E8779).
```

**Output** (`resolved-permissions.json`):
```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "contracts": {
    "eth:0xc3d688B66703497DAA19211EEdff47f25384cdc3": {
      "functions": [{
        "functionName": "changeAdmin",
        "directOwners": ["eth:0x1EC63B5883C3481134FD50D5DAebc83Ecd2E8779"],
        "ultimateOwners": [{
          "address": "eth:0x1EC63B5883C3481134FD50D5DAebc83Ecd2E8779",
          "addressType": "Contract",
          "via": [],
          "delays": [],
          "cumulativeDelay": 0
        }]
      }]
    }
  }
}
```

## Key Implementation Details

### Address Format
- **Internal Clingo**: `eth_0x123...` (underscore, not colon)
  - `formatAddress()` converts `eth:0x...` → `eth_0x...`
  - Required because Clingo treats `:` as special character

- **ChainSpecificAddress**: `eth:0x123...` (with colon)
  - Used in address fact third parameter
  - Used in output JSON
  - ModelIdRegistry maps between formats

### Permission Types
- `"act"` - Can execute actions, chains transitively
- `"upgrade"` - Can upgrade contracts
- `"interact"` - Can interact with contracts
- Only `"act"` permissions chain through the transitive rules

### Owner Definition Migration
Added `permissionType` field to owner definitions:
```json
{
  "ownerDefinitions": [
    {
      "path": "$self.$admin",
      "permissionType": "act"  // ← New field (defaults to "act" if missing)
    }
  ]
}
```

## Next Steps / Potential Solutions

### Option 1: Investigate WebAssembly Memory Configuration
- Check if `clingo-wasm` has memory configuration options
- Look at L2BEAT's production usage of Clingo
- May need to increase WASM heap size or adjust solver parameters

### Option 2: Optimize Fact Generation
- Reduce number of facts by filtering out unnecessary ones
- Pre-compute transitive chains in TypeScript instead of Clingo
- Use Clingo only for complex permission resolution, not simple chains

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
- Use custom recursive resolution for large projects
- Use Clingo resolution for small/medium projects
- Add project size check and route accordingly

### Option 4: Native Clingo Fallback
- Use native Clingo binary for large projects (if available on server)
- Keep WebAssembly for browser/simple cases
- Requires system dependency but removes WASM limitations

### Option 5: Simplify modelPermissions.lp Rules
- Create a simpler version of L2BEAT's rules optimized for our use case
- Remove expensive recursive expansions
- Focus only on the permission patterns we actually use

### Option 6: Batch Processing
- Split large projects into smaller chunks
- Resolve permissions incrementally
- Merge results in TypeScript

## Testing

### To Test Compound-v3 (Working)
```bash
cd /home/emilien/defidisco/packages/config
PORT=3021 l2b ui
curl -X POST http://localhost:3021/api/projects/compound-v3/resolve-permissions
# Check: packages/config/src/projects/compound-v3/resolved-permissions.json
```

### To Test Lido (Currently Failing)
```bash
cd /home/emilien/defidisco/packages/config
PORT=3021 l2b ui
curl -X POST http://localhost:3021/api/projects/lido/resolve-permissions
# Result: WebAssembly abort after ~7 seconds
```

### Debug Output Location
```bash
# View generated Clingo facts + rules
cat packages/config/src/projects/lido/clingo-debug.lp

# Count facts
grep "^permission(" packages/config/src/projects/lido/clingo-debug.lp | wc -l  # 147
grep "^address(" packages/config/src/projects/lido/clingo-debug.lp | wc -l     # 40
grep "^canActIndependently(" packages/config/src/projects/lido/clingo-debug.lp | wc -l  # Should match addresses without "act" permissions
```

## Conclusion

The Clingo integration is **functionally correct** and demonstrates that L2BEAT's permission resolution approach works for our data structure. The issue is purely a **resource limitation** in the WebAssembly environment when processing larger fact sets.

For production use, we need to either:
1. Find a way to increase WASM memory/resources
2. Optimize the fact generation to reduce complexity
3. Use a hybrid approach (Clingo for small, custom for large)
4. Investigate how L2BEAT handles large projects in production

The implementation is clean, well-structured, and follows the minimal integration principle by keeping all DefidDisco code in `/defidisco/` folders.
